        <h2> Cryptocurrency: How To Begin </h2>
        <p> Now that you’ve decided to start investing in cryptocurrency, here is what you should know what’s drawing
            you to
            this new asset class. Basically, once you realize that cryptos are the future, then you will automatically
            be
            drawn
            to them.
            Once you’ve made up your mind, you need to choose which crypto you want to invest in and how much money you
            want
            to
            put in. Look at popular options like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also keep an eye out for lesser-known coins
            that
            have
            the potential to jump spectacularly compared to its popular peers.
            To invest money, you will first need to sign up with a crypto exchange service in India, complete the KYC
            process
            and then transfer funds from your bank to the exchange to buy your first crypto. We recommend bitcoin
            exchange
            app
            CryptoWorld for more reasons that just the fact that it’s one of the oldest and most well-regarded crypto
            exchanges
            in
            the country.

            ZebPay, which impressed us with its intuitive and clutter-free app, also has some unique features that makes
            it
            easy
            to recommend. Take CryptoWorld Earn for example. This feature allows you to earn crypto simply for holding
            on to
            crypto –
            almost like getting an interest rate on your crypto savings. With the rate of return varying between 1% to
            7.5%
            depending on which coins you hold, sitting and earning crpyto has never been easier.

        <h2>Things To Know As A First Time Crypto Investor</h2>
        <p> As an additional resource, keep the following things in mind while you’re investing for the first time. <br>
            1 - Allocate a tiny amount of your portfolio to cryptocurrency in the beginning. Don’t put in any more than
            you can afford to lose. <br>
            2 – You don’t need thousands of rupees to start investing in cryptocurrency. Exchanges usually offer the
            option
            to
            start investing with as little as INR 100. This way, you can buy a fraction of any crypto such as Bitcoin
            instead of
            an entire coin. <br>
            3 – Keep an eye out for regulations and news from the government. While cryptos aren’t banned in India,
            there
            can be
            a lot of conflicting information regarding its regulation. Follow the right groups, forums and news sources
            to
            stay
            up to date with the latest information. <br>
            4– Remember the golden adage, if something is too good to be true, it probably is. Certain crypto exchanges
            offer
            mind-numbing returns but if cryptocurrencies crash, you lose everything in one go too. Stick to known crypto
            exchanges such as CryptoWorld.
            We wish you all the very best in your new journey into the world of cryptocurrency. Stay tuned and visit us
            soon
