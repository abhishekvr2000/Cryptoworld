        <h2>The evolution of cryptocurrency</h2>
        <img src="/images/evo.jpeg" class="d-block mx-lg-auto img-fluid" alt="Bootstrap Themes" width="600" height="500"
            loading="lazy">
        <p>In recent years, cryptocurrency—and in particular, Bitcoin—has demonstrated its value, now boasting 14
            million
            Bitcoins in circulation. Investors speculating in the future possibilities of this new technology have
            driven
            most of the current market capitalization, and this is likely to remain the case until a certain measure of
            price stability and market acceptance is achieved. Apart from the declared price of cryptocurrency, those
            invested in it appear to be relying on a perceived “inherent value” of cryptocurrency. This includes the
            technology and network itself, the integrity of the cryptographic code and the decentralized network.

            The blockchain public ledger technology (which underlies cryptocurrency) has the potential to disrupt a wide
            variety of transactions, in addition to the traditional payments system. These include stocks, bonds and
            other
            financial assets for which records are stored digitally and for which currently there is a need for a
            trusted
            third party to provide verification of the transaction.

            In our view, the cryptocurrency market will develop at a pace set by the key participants, characterized by
            likely growth spurts of legitimacy from one or more of these participants in what we call “credentialising
            moments.” For the market to reach the next phase in its evolution toward mainstream acceptance and stable
            expansion, each of the five key market participants—merchants and consumers, tech developers, investors,
            financial institutions and regulators—will play a role.</p>

        <h2>Keys to market development</h2>
        <p> Consumers and merchants
            For consumers, cryptocurrencies offer cheaper and faster peer-to-peer payment options than those offered by
            traditional money services businesses, without the need to provide personal details. While cryptocurrencies
            continue to gain some acceptance as a payment option, price volatility and the opportunity for speculative
            investments encourage consumers not to use cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services but rather to trade
            it.

            Only 6% of respondents to PwC’s 2015 Consumer Cryptocurrency Survey say they are either “very” or
            “extremely” familiar with cryptocurrencies. We anticipate that familiarity will increase as consumers begin
            to have access to innovative offerings and services not otherwise available through traditional payment
            systems.

            From the perspective of businesses and merchants, cryptocurrencies offer low transaction fees and lower
            volatility risk resulting from nearly instantaneous settlement, and they eliminate the possibility of
            chargebacks (the demand by a credit card provider that a retailer make good on the loss of a fraudulent or
            disputed transaction).</p>

            <h4>RISK STATEMENT</h4>
            The trading of Bitcoins, alternative cryptocurrencies has potential rewards, and it also
            has potential risks involved. Trading may not be suitable for all people. Anyone wishing to invest
            should seek his or her own independent financial or professional advice.
